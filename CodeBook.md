####**DATASET Tfinal**

####**CodeBook:**

Dataset Tfinal, to be found in this same Repository, was selected from a larger database prepared by UCI'S Machine Learning Repository

Dataset Tfinal is part of assignements in Coursera/Johns Hopkins U MOOC "Getting and Cleaning Data"

####**Feature Selection** 
=================

The features selected for the source original UCI's database (containing more tha 10.000 observations of 561 
different types of measurements) come from various accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ,
generated by the behaviour of 30 volunteers (the "SUBJECTS") performing ordinary activities (the "ACTIVITY")(see below),
captured by a weared Samsung smartphone duly adapted for the research.

The features **selected** for our Dataset Tfinal come from a subset of them as follows:

tBodyAcc-mean ( for each -XYZ types)
tBodyAcc-std ( for each -XYZ types)
tGravityAcc-mean (for each -XYZ types)
tGravityAcc-std (for each -XYZ types)

In details, selected features for our Tfinal were:

1.  tBodyAcc-mean()-X,		(simplified name adopted:  BAccmX
2.  tBodyAcc-mean()-Y,		                           BAccmY 
3.  tBodyAcc-mean()-Z                                      BAccmZ 
4.  tBodyAcc-std()-X                                       BAccsX 
5.  tBodyAcc-std()-Y                                       BAccsY
6.  tBodyAcc-std()-Z                                       BAccsZ
7.  tGravityAcc-mean()-X                                   GAccmX
8.  tGravityAcc-mean()-Y                                   GAccmY
9.  tGravityAcc-mean()-Z                                   GAccmZ
10. tGravityAcc-std()-X                                    GAccsX
11. tGravityAcc-std()-Y                                    GAccsY
12. tGravityAcc-std()-Z                                    GAccsZ

(please note that into semplified namas (m) means mean, (s) means std)

####**Tfinal structure**
================
Tfinal is a .txt file to be read with read.table in R programme, that should return a data.frame (dim 180 observations x 14 variables)

Columns are devoted to above variables:  SUBJECT - ACTIVITY - BAccmX - BAccmY - BAccmZ - BAccsX - BAccsY - BAccsZ - 
GAccmX - GAccmY	- GAccmZ - GAccsX - GAccsY - GAccsZ, where:

SUBJECT: show the ordinal number of the **individual** who volunteered the test (range of course is 1:30) for each value reported
ACTIVITY: indicates the type af **activity** (in a self explanatory abbreviated format) done by the individual while measurements
were taken, as follows

		1. WALKING
		2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		4. SITTING
		5. STANDING
		6. LAYING

Each of the following 12 colums show (by measurements types which name is colums-name) the **mean** (or the **std**) calculated on the 
large number of single measurements taken of that type.
(mean: Mean value)
(std: Standard deviation)

####**FINAL NOTE**
==========

we underline following criteria adopted by Tfinal:

1)	EACH VARIABLE FORMS A COLUMN
2)	EACH OBSERVATION FORMS A ROW BY SUBJECT (IN NUM. ORDER)
3)	SAME OBSERVATION TYPEs (ACTIVITIES) ARE GROUPED by SUBJECT
